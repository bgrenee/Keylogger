Keystroker

**NOTE:** This project is to gain understandings about Cybersecuirty Education. I truly just want to understand
ethical hacking and security testing. **THIS PROJECT IS ONLY FOR EDUCATIONAL INTENTION.**

This mini project is to help me understand malware and how it can operate when collecting data. Through my research
I also learned about listeners and these listeners can not only controll and document keyboard, but also mice. Though, in 
this project, I only document keystrokes and do not controll the keystrokes. Simply to document the users keystrokes.
